In this blog post, we'll discuss rate limiters, a critical component in distributed systems to
prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of resources. We'll cover the different types of rate
limiters and their use cases, and we'll provide examples of how to use them with the minimalist-java
http-api module.

## Token Bucket

- Parameters: `bucketSize`, `refillRate`.
- Global bucket limits requests across all users.
- Tokens are consumed per request; when out of tokens, requests are dropped until the next
  refill.
- Example:
    - bucketSize = 5, refillRate = 1 token/sec.
      ```
      T0 (01:00:00.000): Bucket starts full with 5 tokens.
      T1 (01:00:01.100): 1 request arrives, consumes 1 token, 4 tokens left.
      T2 (01:00:01.200): 4 more requests arrive, consume 4 tokens, bucket empty.
      T3 (01:00:01.300): No tokens, requests dropped. Bucket refills 1 token per second.
      T4 (01:00:02.000): Bucket is refilled with all 5 tokens.
      T5 (01:00:02.100): 1 request arrives, consumes 1 token, 4 tokens left.
      T6 (01:00:03.000): No more requests so far. Bucket is refilled back to 5 tokens (adds 4 missing ones).
      ```

## Leaking Bucket

- Parameters: `bucketSize`, `leakRate`.
- Requests are queued and processed at a fixed rate, smoothing out traffic spikes.
- Excess requests are dropped if the queue is full.
- Example:
    - bucketSize = 4, leakRate = 1 request/2 sec.
      ```
      T0 (01:00:00): Bucket empty, 1 request arrives and enters the queue.
      T1 (01:00:02): 1st request processed (leaked out), 3 more arrive and queue up.
      T2 (01:00:03): Requests arrinving at this time are all dropped, because queue if full.
      T3 (01:00:04): 2nd request processed, 2 in queue, new requests continue to queue if space.
      ```

## Fixed Window Counter

- Parameters: `windowSize`, `maxRequests`.
- Counts requests in fixed time windows; excess requests are dropped once the limit is reached.
- Susceptible to bursts at window boundaries, potentially allowing double the limit across two
  windows.
- Example:
    - windowSize = 1 sec, requestLimit = 3.
      ```
        | 5         X           X       ■ => request allowed
        | 4         X   X       X       X => request dropped
        | 3     ■   ■   ■       ■
        | 2     ■   ■   ■   ■   ■
        | 1     ■   ■   ■   ■   ■
        |_____________________________
        (sec)   1s  2s  3s  4s  5s
      ```

    - A problem with this algorithm is that a burst of traffic at the edges of time
      windows could cause more requests than allowed quota to go through. Consider the following
      case:
      ```
      Requests (excess at the edges of window):
        5         |               |          ■ => request allowed
        4         |           ■   |          X => request dropped
        3         | ■         ■   |           
        2         | ■ ■       ■ X |           
        1         | ■ ■     ■ ■ X |           
        |_________|_______|_______|___________
        00:00   00:30   01:00   01:30   02:00   (min:sec)
                              <---- Window --->
      ```
      In Figure above, the system allows a maximum of 5 requests per minute, and the available
      quota
      resets at the human-friendly round minute. As seen, there are five requests between 00:00
      and 01:00 and five more requests between 01:00 and 02:00. For the one-minute window
      between 00:30 and 01:30, 10 requests go through. That is twice as many as allowed
      requests.

## Sliding Window Log

- Parameter: `capacity`, `threshold`
- Maintains a log of timestamps for each request, providing an exact count within the sliding
  window.
- Enables accurate rate limiting by considering the exact timing of requests.
- Suitable for scenarios where maintaining an accurate request count is crucial.
- Example:
    - windowSize = 1 min, maxRequests = 10.
      ```
      T0 (01:00:00): Window starts, request log is empty.
      T1 (01:00:10): 2 requests arrive, timestamps [01:00:10, 01:00:10] logged.
      T2 (01:00:20): 3 requests arrive, timestamps [01:00:20, 01:00:20, 01:00:20] logged.
      T3 (01:00:30): Window slides, timestamps before 00:59:30 are no longer counted.
      T4 (01:00:40): 2 more requests, timestamps [01:00:40, 01:00:40] added, older timestamps within window considered for count.
      T5 (01:01:00): Window slides, only timestamps after 01:00:00 are counted, older ones are discarded.
      ```

## Sliding Window Counter with Slots

- Parameters: `windowSize`, `maxRequests`.
- Divides the window into smaller slots for a more granular count.
- Slides the window by updating slot counts, allowing a smooth transition and more evenly
  distributed rate limiting.
- Approximates actual sliding window behavior with improved performance.
- Example:
    - windowSize = 1 min, slots = 6 (10 sec/slot), maxRequests = 10.
      ```
      T0 (01:00:00): Window starts, 6 slots initialized with 0 requests.
      T1 (01:00:20): 4 requests arrive, distributed in the first 2 slots.
      T2 (01:00:40): Window slides, first 2 slots cleared, 4 requests in next 2 slots.
      T3 (01:00:50): 3 more requests, fit into the 5th slot, total 7 requests allowed.
      ```

## Approximate Sliding Window Counter

- Parameters: `windowSize`, `maxRequests`.
- Utilizes current and previous window counts with a weighting system based on time elapsed in
  the current window.
- Offers a balance between accuracy and efficiency, smoothing out traffic spikes with minimal
  memory usage.
- Suitable for use cases where an exact count is less critical.
- Example:
    - windowSize = 1 min, maxRequests = 7.
      ```
      T0 (01:00:00): Window starts, 0 requests counted.
      T1 (01:00:30): Previous window had 5 requests, current window has 2.
      T2 (01:00:45): New request evaluated with weighted count: 2 (current) + 5 * 0.75 (previous
      weighted) = 5.75, rounded down to 5, request allowed.
      T3 (01:01:00): Window resets, counting starts afresh for the new minute.

        Requests (weighted from previous window):
        7 |             |                    ■ => request allowed in previous window                                
        6 |             |                    ● => request allowed in current window (weighted from previous window)
        5 |■ ■ ■ ■ ■    |                    + => new request evaluated with weighted count
        4 |             |                    │ => window limit
        3 |             |          
        2 |             |          
        1 |             |● ●       |+
          |_____________|__________|_____________
        01:00       01:00:30   01:00:45   01:01:00   (min:sec)
                  <------ Window ------->
      
      --
       
      At T0 (01:00:00), the window starts with 0 requests counted (│ indicates the window limit, which is 7).
      At T1 (01:00:30), we're in the middle of the current window. The previous window had 5 requests (■), and the current window has 2 requests (●).
      At T2 (01:00:45), a new request arrives (+). The weighted count from the previous window (5 requests at 75% weight) is added to the 2 current requests, resulting in a total of 5.75, which is rounded down to 5. The new request is allowed.
      At T3 (01:01:00), the window resets, and the counting starts afresh for the new minute. All counts from the previous window are no longer applicable. 
      
        Requests (weighted from previous window):
          7 |             |             |           ■ => request allowed in previous window
          6 |             |             |           ● => request allowed in current window
          5 |■ ■ ■ ■ ■    |             |           + => new request evaluated with weighted count
          4 |             |             |           │ => window limit
          3 |             |● ● ●        |           
          2 |             |             |           
          1 |             |             |           
            |_____________|_____________|___________|

## How to use it with minimalist-java

Use
the [RateLimitFactory](https://github.com/giovannymassuia/minimalist-java/blob/main/modules/http-api/src/main/java/io/giovannymassuia/minimalist/java/lib/ratelimiter/RateLimitFactory.java)
to get a default instance of a rate limiter implementation or to customize the init config.

```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Api.create(8080).rateLimit(
                RateLimitFactory.customFixedWindowCounter(3, Duration.ofSeconds(1)))
            .addRoute(Route.builder("/").path(RouteMethod.GET, "/", ctx ->
                ResponseEntity.ok(Map.of("message", "Hello World!"))
            )).start();
    }

}
```

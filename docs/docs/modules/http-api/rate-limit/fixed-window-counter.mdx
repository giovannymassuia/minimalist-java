# Fixed Window Counter

### Parameters

- `maxRequests`, `windowSize`.

### Description

- Counts requests in fixed time windows; excess requests are dropped once the limit is reached.
- Susceptible to bursts at window boundaries, potentially allowing double the limit across two
windows.

:::note
A major drawback of the fixed window counter algorithm is that it is susceptible to bursts of
traffic at the edges of time windows, which can cause more requests than the allowed quota to go
through. The excess can go as high as double the limit across two windows.
:::

Example: `windowSize = 1 sec`, `requestLimit = 3`.

```
    | 5         X           X       ■ => request allowed
    | 4         X   X       X       X => request dropped
    | 3     ■   ■   ■       ■
    | 2     ■   ■   ■   ■   ■
    | 1     ■   ■   ■   ■   ■
    |_____________________________
    (sec)   1s  2s  3s  4s  5s

```
    Requests (excess at the edges of window):
    5         |               |
    4         |           ■   |         ■ => request allowed
    3         | ■         ■   |         X => request dropped
    2         | ■ ■       ■ X |
    1         | ■ ■     ■ ■ X |
    |_________|_______|_______|___________

              <---- Window --->

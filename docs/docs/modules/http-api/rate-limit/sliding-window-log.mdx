# Sliding Window Log

### Parameters

- `capacity`, `threshold`

### Description

- Maintains a log of timestamps for each request, providing an exact count within the sliding
window.
- Enables accurate rate limiting by considering the exact timing of requests.
- Suitable for scenarios where maintaining an accurate request count is crucial.

Example: `windowSize = 1 min`, `maxRequests = 5`.

- `T0 (01:00:00)`: Window starts, request log is empty.
- `T1 (01:00:10)`: 2 requests arrive, timestamps `[01:00:10, 01:00:10]` logged.
- `T2 (01:00:20)`: 3 requests arrive, timestamps `[01:00:20, 01:00:20, 01:00:20]` logged.
- `T3 (01:00:30)`: 1 request arrives, timestamp `[01:00:30]` logged. But the window is full, so the
request is dropped.
- `T4 (01:01:20)`: Now the logs before `01:00:20` are cleared, and the new request is allowed.
Because the window is sliding, and the window has room for more requests.
